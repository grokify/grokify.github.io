The culling process does not necessarily take into account the composition of the data set; and may, in fact, impede the expediency and cost-effectiveness of the eDiscovery process as ESI not initially identified may need to be collected later in the eDiscovery process. This exclusionary eDiscovery approach has been recommended by search and information retrieval technology providers in the past, in part, based on the state of technology available at the time; however, the technology now exists to perform an inclusive, content-based, investigative eDiscovery across a large document collection without the introduction of semiarbitrary exclusion factors. In this paper, we investigate whether limited document retrieval based on custodian email mailboxes results in lower recall and produces fewer responsive documents than a broader, inclusive search process that covers all potential custodians. In order to compare the two approaches, we designed an experiment with two independent teams conducting electronic discovery using the different approaches. We found that searching across the entire data set resulted in finding significantly more responsive documents and more initial custodians than implementing an approach that relies on custodian-based culling. Specifically, investigative eDiscovery found 516% more relevant documents and 1825% more initial custodians in our study. Based on these results, we believe organizations that employ an exclusionary, culling-based methodology may require subsequent collections, risk under production and sanctions during litigation, and will ultimately expend more resources in responding to eDiscovery production requests with a less comprehensive result.","title":"John's Publications"},{"location":"links/#johns-publications","text":"","title":"John's Publications"},{"location":"links/#papers","text":"","title":"Papers"},{"location":"links/#comparing-exclusionary-and-investigative-approaches-for-electronic-discovery-using-the-trec-enron-corpus","text":"Link: https://trec.nist.gov/pubs/trec18/papers/zlti.legal.pdf","title":"Comparing Exclusionary and Investigative Approaches for Electronic Discovery using the TREC Enron Corpus"},{"location":"links/#abstract","text":"Organizations responding to requests to produce electronically stored information (ESI) for litigation today often conduct information retrieval with a limited amount of data that has first been culled by custodian mailboxes, date ranges, or other factors chosen semi-arbitrarily based on legal negotiations or other exogenous factors.

We wanted to create an opportunity to showcase innovative leaders and their developer portals in the API and interface space. The DevPortal Awards is an opportunity to celebrate the work that goes into developer portals that are not only targeted to developers but also aligned to business needs and operable by its maintainers. The DevPortal Awards seeks to recognize the best solutions available today and push the boundaries of what we believe to be the key components of a developer portal for tomorrow. Award Introduction of the portal RingCentral Developers portal combines powerful APIs with a focus on usability and community. Developers will find quick start guides that create apps for them in a matter of minutes, interactive documentation, tutorials, SDKs for 11 languages, and more combined with RingCentral's focus on supporting their community through live chat, forums, social media, and even with free 1-1 developer support. Once in the Developer Portal, developers will also find more details including usage and error analytics to help them monitor their app's health. Then there's RingCentral's Game Changer program that rewards developers with prizes like swag, conference passes, and even electronics like iPads and Macbook Pros just for helping others in the community!

This article outlines the additional knowledge and insights gained during the renewal process and emphasizes the significance of staying up-to-date with Scrum certifications. Introduction Renewing my Scrum Alliance certifications for Certified ScrumMaster (CSM) and Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO) turned out to be a more rewarding experience than I had anticipated. In this article, I will share the valuable insights and learnings I acquired during the renewal process, emphasizing the importance of staying connected with Scrum Alliance and its resources. This is what my certificate looked like when I received it in 2012, with a 2 year lifespan and expiration in 2014. And this is what it looked like in 2023 with the inactive notice. Of note, the design changed, but so much time had passed that an intermediate design had come and gone as well. The Decision After over a decade since initially obtaining my CSM and CSPO certifications, I decided it was time to renew them. Despite working in various agile organizations during the intervening years, I hadn't felt the need to update my certifications. However, circumstances changed when I found myself in an organization undergoing an agile transformation, prompting me to advance my agile journey with Scrum Alliance. My goal was to progress through the Advanced levels and beyond, which required me to update my certificates through education and a fee. Initially, I viewed this as a mere prerequisite for accessing the Advanced level programs. However, I soon realized that the journey itself held immense value, and I found great benefit in acquiring the required education, as detailed below. The Requirements Renewing my certifications initially seemed daunting due to the substantial amount of time that had passed and the requirement of 40 Scrum Education Units (SEUs) for both my CSM and CSPO certifications (20 each). However, it turned out that I only needed 30 SEUs in total, thanks to a 10 SEU discount for renewing both certifications simultaneously. To meet the SEU requirement, I explored various avenues, including: Reading articles. Watching videos. Attending conferences and meetups. Engaging in volunteer work. While volunteer Scrum work was the most SEU-rich option, it proved to be scarce and required some lead time. Similarly, attending conferences and meetups took time. Consequently, I began by watching videos and reading articles. Initially, I manually inputted these activities into the Scrum Alliance website, but later discovered the convenience of automatic SEU tracking. The Content Throughout the renewal process, I delved into numerous articles and watched several videos. These resources expanded my understanding and appreciation of Scrum and Agile methodologies. Some of the articles were so informative that I saved them for future reference. Here are a few noteworthy articles: Get in FRONT of the Daily Scrum by Bonsy Yelsangi 7 Traits of a Good Facilitator by Scrum Alliance The Differences Between Project Managers and Scrum Masters by Natalie Barnes The Anatomy of a User Story by Jim Schiel How to Stop Facilitating the World's Most Boring Meetings by Vibhu Srinivasan How Much Detail Should Be In My Product Roadmap? Sample Sprint Review Agenda & Tips from a Coach by Joel Bancroft-Connors How to Become a Catalyst Leader 3 Traits Great Agile Leaders Display (Plus 1 Factor That Doesn\u2019t Matter at All) Great Scrum Masters Demonstrate 5 Key Values Measuring Progress Toward Agility The Renewal The Scrum Alliance dashboard provided an informative progress meter, updated in near real-time after completing content on the website. Surprisingly, I made faster progress than expected, earning 0.25 SEU per article. By the time I completed my renewal, my dashboard indicated significant progress, and I successfully updated my certification, which was now active once more. This is what my dashboard looked liked part way through the process. By the time I renewed, my dashboard looked like the following: And I was able to update my cert, which showed it was active again. The Community Scrum Alliance's thriving community is one of its greatest strengths. From mandatory classes to conferences and various resources, Scrum Alliance fosters a sense of belonging and collaboration. I appreciated that my certificates included the names of Certified Scrum Trainers who had instructed me: Michael James for CSM and Chris Sims for CSPO. Moreover, the renewal process allowed me to become acquainted with more members of the Scrum Alliance community through the articles they authored, some of which I mentioned earlier. Witnessing the active participation of individuals in writing articles and engaging in Scrum Alliance programs was inspiring. Summary Scrum Alliance's emphasis on people, through its classes, conferences, content, and community, makes it a valuable organization. The certification renewal process, requiring Scrum Education Units (SEUs), not only enhances one's knowledge of content but also deepens their connection to the Scrum Alliance community. I eagerly look forward to continuing my learning journey with this organization and its dedicated members.","title":"The Value of Renewing Scrum Alliance Certifications (CSM and CSPO)"},{"location":"certificates/scrum_scrumalliance-renewal/#the-value-of-renewing-scrum-alliance-certifications-csm-and-cspo","text":"","title":"The Value of Renewing Scrum Alliance Certifications (CSM and CSPO)"},{"location":"certificates/scrum_scrumalliance-renewal/#tldr","text":"Renewing my Scrum Alliance Certified ScrumMaster (CSM) and Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO) certifications exceeded my expectations and provided valuable benefits.

Yes , static typing is becoming increasingly popular and widely adopted in the Python community , especially for large-scale or production-grade applications. Here\u2019s why\u2014and how it\u2019s being used: \u2705 Why Static Typing Is Gaining Popularity in Python 1. Better Tooling Static typing enables powerful IDE features like: Autocompletion Refactoring tools Type-aware navigation Examples: VS Code, PyCharm, and mypy-based linters can catch bugs before runtime. 2. Improved Code Quality and Maintainability Type annotations help clarify what functions expect and return. Makes onboarding easier for teams\u2014especially on large codebases. Encourages more deliberate API design. 3. Optional by Design Python\u2019s type hints are optional and don\u2019t change runtime behavior . This allows teams to: Gradually adopt typing Mix typed and untyped code safely \ud83e\uddf0 How Static Typing Is Implemented Python introduced type hints in: PEP 484 (Python 3.5): basic type hints using the typing module PEP 563 & PEP 604 : cleaner and more expressive type syntax in Python 3.9+ Example: def greet(name: str) -> str: return f\"Hello, {name}\" With complex types: from typing import List, Optional def average(nums: List[int]) -> Optional[float]: if not nums: return None return sum(nums) / len(nums) \ud83d\udd0d Static Type Checkers and Tools mypy \u2013 Most popular static type checker pyright / pylance \u2013 Fast type checker by Microsoft (used in VS Code) Pyre \u2013 Type checker developed by Meta (Facebook) They don\u2019t affect runtime , but catch type errors during development. \ud83d\udcc8 Where It's Especially Popular Large codebases (e.g., Dropbox, Instagram, YouTube) Teams with mixed backgrounds (from Java, C++, etc.) Data science and machine learning projects, using tools like pandas-stubs and numpy.typing \ud83e\udd14 Is Python Becoming a Statically Typed Language? No\u2014Python remains dynamically typed by default , but it's evolving to support static typing as a first-class tool . Most new Python libraries and frameworks (e.g., FastAPI, Pydantic, Strawberry) now include or strongly encourage type annotations. \ud83e\uddf5 Summary \u2714 Static typing is increasingly popular in Python, especially in professional development. \ud83d\udd27 Tools like mypy and pyright make it practical and powerful. \ud83e\udde9 Adoption is optional and gradual , fitting well with Python's dynamic roots. If you're working on a project and wondering whether to adopt typing, I can help you develop a strategy to incrementally introduce it. Chat 2 can python compile to a static binary? Yes , Python can compile to a static binary\u2014 but it's not built-in and requires external tools . The goal is usually to package Python applications as standalone executables that can run without requiring the user to have Python installed. Here's how that works and the tradeoffs: \ud83d\udd27 Tools That Compile Python to Static Binaries \u2705 1. PyInstaller Packages a Python application into a single executable. Bundles the interpreter and all dependencies. Can create a single-file binary , but not fully static (still depends on libc/glibc). Cross-compilation is tricky. pyinstaller --onefile your_script.py \u2705 2. Nuitka Translates Python to C/C++ and compiles with a C compiler. Produces optimized, compiled executables. More performance-oriented than PyInstaller. Can be used to build mostly static binaries with proper setup. nuitka --standalone --onefile your_script.py \u2705 3. Shiv / Pex (for zipapps) Package Python apps into .pyz files that behave like single binaries. Still requires the user to have Python installed. Great for virtualenv-style packaging. \u2705 4. PyOxidizer Builds truly standalone, statically linked binaries . Uses Rust to embed Python interpreter and code. Still maturing, but very powerful for embedded or cross-platform builds. \u2705 5. Staticx (wraps executables) Wraps dynamically linked binaries with a statically linked launcher. Useful in combination with PyInstaller or Nuitka to produce truly static binaries. Great for containers or legacy systems. \ud83d\udce6 What\u2019s in the Binary? Typically includes: Python interpreter Your app\u2019s code All imported modules and dependencies Shared libraries (sometimes statically linked, sometimes dynamically) \u2757 Gotchas and Limitations Size : Final binary can be large (10\u2013100 MB+). Performance : Little or no performance gain unless you're using tools like Nuitka that compile Python to C. Cross-platform compilation : Not trivial. You'll usually need to compile on the target OS (e.g., compile on Linux for Linux). Licensing : Some libraries may not be statically linkable due to licensing (e.g., GPL). \u2705 Summary Tool Static? One-file? Notes PyInstaller Semi-static \u2705 Most popular, works for most apps Nuitka More static \u2705 Better performance, C backend PyOxidizer Fully static \u2705 Most advanced, Rust-based Staticx Fully static \u2705 Wraps other executables Yes, you can compile Python to a static binary , but you'll likely need a tool like Nuitka , PyInstaller + Staticx , or PyOxidizer . Let me know your platform (Linux, Windows, macOS) and use case\u2014e.g., CLI tool, GUI app, embedded system\u2014and I can recommend the best setup for that. Chat 3 what has more performance Nuitka or PyOxidizer? And which is more maintained? Great question. Here's a direct comparison of Nuitka and PyOxidizer in terms of performance and maintenance : \u26a1\ufe0f Performance Comparison \u2705 Nuitka Transpiles Python to C/C++ , then compiles to a native binary using a C compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC). Can eliminate some Python runtime overhead. Produces real machine code; faster startup and better CPU performance than interpreted Python. Uses a custom runtime that still embeds parts of CPython (e.g., reference counting is preserved). Performance gains: Moderate to significant for compute-heavy workloads . Less pronounced for I/O-bound or interpreter-heavy workloads. \u2705 PyOxidizer Embeds the Python interpreter using Rust and packages everything as a static binary. Does not compile Python code to machine code \u2014your .pyc (bytecode) files still run via CPython. Focus is on distribution, isolation, and startup performance , not on runtime execution speed. Performance gains: Faster startup than normal Python. Runtime performance similar to vanilla Python. \ud83c\udfc6 Winner: Nuitka wins for runtime performance due to C-level compilation. PyOxidizer wins for startup speed and binary embedding but not for raw execution speed. \ud83d\udd27 Maintenance and Ecosystem \u2705 Nuitka Actively maintained by a dedicated maintainer (Kay Hayen) and a growing community. Frequent releases (monthly or better), with good changelogs. Excellent documentation and supports a wide range of Python versions and libraries. Mature and widely used in production (e.g., CLI tools, standalone apps). Supports: Python 2.6\u20133.12+ Windows, Linux, macOS PyPI packages, virtualenv, complex imports \u2705 PyOxidizer Created by Gregory Szorc (Mozilla engineer). Written in Rust; actively maintained but less frequent updates than Nuitka. Smaller community and user base. Still evolving \u2014more cutting-edge, more complexity. Targeted more at DevOps and systems engineers than general Python developers. Complex setup for large apps. \ud83c\udfc6 Winner: Nuitka is more actively maintained , better documented, and more production-ready . PyOxidizer is powerful but less mature and more niche . \ud83e\udde0 Summary Table Feature Nuitka PyOxidizer Performance \u2705 Faster runtime (compiled to C) \u26a0\ufe0f Similar to normal Python (bytecode) Startup time \u26a0\ufe0f Slightly slower (more deps) \u2705 Faster (Rust static binary) Maintenance \u2705 Frequent updates, mature \u26a0\ufe0f Less active, smaller community Complexity \u2705 Easy to use, good docs \u26a0\ufe0f Steeper learning curve Binary Size \u26a0\ufe0f Larger in many cases \u2705 Leaner binaries possible Use Cases General apps, CLI tools, optimization Embedded apps, secure binaries \ud83d\udca1 Recommendation Choose Nuitka if: You want faster runtime performance . You need compatibility with complex Python packages. You want a mature, supported, and practical solution. Choose PyOxidizer if: You want ultra-fast startup and static binaries . You\u2019re embedding Python into Rust apps or building sandboxed apps. You\u2019re comfortable with a more complex, less-documented toolchain. Let me know your platform and target use case (e.g., distributing a CLI tool, shrinking container images, securing IP) and I can recommend a best-practice setup. Chat 4 which is better for ML? When it comes to machine learning (ML) , Nuitka is generally better suited than PyOxidizer, and here\u2019s why: \u2705 Why Nuitka Is Better for ML Workloads 1. Compatibility with ML Libraries ML relies heavily on packages like NumPy , Pandas , scikit-learn , TensorFlow , and PyTorch . Nuitka supports most of these out-of-the-box, including: Native extensions ( .so / .pyd files) C-accelerated modules like NumPy Complex dependencies like pandas and scikit-learn PyOxidizer has limited support for packages with native extensions , especially those involving complex C/C++ binaries. \u2705 Winner : Nuitka 2. Runtime Performance ML workloads are often CPU- or GPU-bound , and C-level compilation can improve: Data preprocessing and transformation steps Custom numerical routines While ML model training/inference is usually handled by C/C++/CUDA libraries (e.g., TensorFlow backend), Nuitka still helps speed up the surrounding Python orchestration code. \u2705 Winner : Nuitka 3. Ease of Packaging Nuitka can bundle entire ML projects\u2014including model files, preprocessing code, and dependencies\u2014into a single binary or directory. PyOxidizer is much more complex for ML packaging and often breaks with native libs or compiled wheels (e.g., .whl files for TensorFlow). \u2705 Winner : Nuitka 4. Production Use in ML Pipelines Nuitka works well in: Inference pipelines CLI tools for model scoring or analysis Desktop or edge ML deployments PyOxidizer is more focused on embedding and shipping lightweight tools, not large ML workflows. \u2705 Winner : Nuitka \u26a0\ufe0f PyOxidizer Limitations for ML Complex ML libs often require shared libraries and dynamic loading, which conflicts with PyOxidizer\u2019s static packaging goals . It does not currently handle .so , .pyd , or Cython-based packages gracefully. It\u2019s harder to debug or update if you\u2019re actively iterating on ML models. \ud83e\udde0 Summary Table Feature Nuitka PyOxidizer ML library support \u2705 Excellent \u274c Limited Performance for data wrangling \u2705 Better \u26a0\ufe0f Similar to Python GPU library support \u2705 Compatible \u274c Unproven Ease of packaging ML stacks \u2705 Easier \u274c Harder Use in production inference \u2705 Widely used \u26a0\ufe0f Niche use \ud83d\udd0d Bottom Line For ML projects\u2014especially ones involving TensorFlow, PyTorch, NumPy , or pandas \u2014you should use Nuitka . PyOxidizer is powerful for embedded or CLI-style applications, but not ready for the complexity of modern ML workloads . Let me know your target platform (Linux, macOS, Windows) and whether you're targeting training, inference, or packaging, and I can suggest a setup or example build process.","title":"Python Chat"},{"location":"chats/chat_2025-06-03_python-static-typing-binary/#python-chat","text":"","title":"Python Chat"},{"location":"chats/chat_2025-06-03_python-static-typing-binary/#chat-1","text":"is static typing popular in python?

OSCAL CSAF SPDX+Vex CycloneDX+Vex OpenVex For vulnerability reporting with remediation and false positive info , especially in the context of container scans (e.g., Microsoft Defender for Containers, AWS Inspector), the most popular and practical choice currently is: 4. CycloneDX + VEX Here\u2019s why: \u2705 CycloneDX + VEX (Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange) Popularity: CycloneDX is widely adopted across the SBOM and DevSecOps communities, including support from OWASP and commercial vendors like Sonatype, Anchore, and others. VEX Integration: CycloneDX supports embedded VEX data, allowing you to convey: Whether a vulnerability is exploitable in a specific context. Remediation steps. Justifications for marking a vulnerability as a false positive (e.g., not affected, configuration prevents exploit). Tool Support: Tools like Grype , Anchore , IntelliJ , VS Code , and Dependency-Track support CycloneDX and VEX integration. Interoperability: JSON and XML formats, good CI/CD tooling support.

Chat 2 Why is CSAF \"Great for vendors publishing advisories\"? CSAF (Common Security Advisory Framework) is \"great for vendors publishing advisories\" because that is exactly what it was designed for. Here's why: \ud83e\uddfe 1. Purpose-Built for Security Advisories CSAF was developed by the FIRST (Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams) to standardize how vendors share vulnerability information . It focuses on publishing security advisories , especially CVE-based disclosures , in a machine-readable format. \ud83d\udd0e 2. Rich Metadata for Vendor Context CSAF supports detailed fields for: Affected products (with CPE and PURL support) CVSS scores and vector strings Remediation steps (patches, workarounds) Vulnerability IDs (CVE, CWE) Exploit status and vendor statements This lets vendors publish authoritative data about: \u201cThis CVE affects Product X version Y, patch Z resolves it, and the risk score is 9.8.\u201d \ud83c\udf10 3. Public Distribution and Trust CSAF allows vendors to sign advisories , host them on public feeds , and enable automated aggregation . Example: Red Hat , Siemens , Cisco , and others publish advisories in CSAF format, making them ingestible by tools and scanners. \ud83d\udd04 4. Designed for Downstream Integration Third-party systems (like SIEMs, vulnerability scanners, ticketing tools) can automatically parse CSAF feeds . This supports automation in threat intelligence , asset vulnerability matching , and incident response . \ud83d\udd27 5. Standards-Based CSAF is an OASIS standard and a successor to CVRF (Common Vulnerability Reporting Framework). It aligns with standards like CVE, CWE, and CPE, and it supports SBOM references (e.g., CycloneDX, SPDX identifiers). \ud83d\udfe8 Why It\u2019s Less Ideal for Internal or Dynamic Workflows While CSAF excels for external publication , it\u2019s: Heavier and more complex than CycloneDX or OpenVEX. Not optimized for internal \"is this vuln actually exploitable in my container?\" workflows. Lacks tight integration with SBOM-first tools. Summary Use Case CSAF Fit Public CVE advisory publication \u2705 Excellent Internal triage or container exploitability \ud83d\udeab Too heavy Integration with dev pipelines \ud83d\udeab Not ideal Security vendor disclosures \u2705 Perfect fit If you're a software vendor publishing advisories to customers or regulators, CSAF is the gold standard . If you're a DevSecOps team handling container scan triage, CycloneDX + VEX is a better fit . Let me know if you want real-world CSAF examples or tooling options. Chat 3 Do companies that provide a CSAF feed, also provide them in other formats? Yes, many companies that provide CSAF feeds also offer their advisories or vulnerability disclosures in other formats , especially HTML , PDF , or RSS , and in some cases, CycloneDX VEX or even plain JSON/CSV APIs . Here's how and why: \u2705 1. Multi-format Publication Is Common Practice Vendors recognize that different audiences and tools consume advisories differently , so they typically offer: Format Audience / Use Case HTML Human-readable web pages for users and analysts PDF Printable, formal documentation JSON/CSV Internal or external API consumers CSAF Machine-readable, structured format for security automation CycloneDX VEX (rarely) Developers/SBOM consumers who need context on exploitability \ud83d\udd0d 2. Examples of Vendors with CSAF + Other Formats Red Hat CSAF: Maintains a structured advisory feed: https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/advisories/ Web Advisories: All RHSA advisories are also published at https://access.redhat.com/errata/ YAML & JSON : Offers JSON/YAML feeds via APIs Cisco CSAF: https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security-pack/csa HTML Web Advisories : All CVEs/advisories are published in readable format RSS Feeds : For syndication Siemens CSAF: https://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories/csaf PDF & Web Pages : Published reports for each vulnerability GitHub Security Advisories Primarily uses GraphQL API and JSON , not CSAF. But GitHub supports exporting advisories as CSAF via tools. \ud83d\udeab Less Common: CSAF + CycloneDX VEX While CycloneDX + VEX is popular for internal tooling and SBOM consumers , few vendors offer both CSAF and VEX feeds publicly , because: They serve different roles: CSAF is for public disclosure; VEX is for internal/consumer-specific context. VEX may require contextual knowledge (e.g., which SBOM/product versions are affected). However, companies like Intel, Bosch, and Red Hat have explored or demoed VEX publication pilots. \u2705 Summary Format Publicly Available Purpose CSAF \u2705 Yes Structured, CVE-centric, machine-readable advisories HTML/PDF \u2705 Yes Human-readable consumption JSON APIs \u2705 Often For automation and internal dashboards CycloneDX + VEX \u2757 Rare Used more in DevSecOps pipelines and internal triage Would you like a table comparing CSAF vs VEX feeds across vendors, or guidance on converting CSAF to VEX for internal use? Is CSAF or OSCAL more popular for reporting vulnerabilities? \ud83d\udd25 CSAF is far more popular than OSCAL for reporting vulnerabilities. Here's a breakdown of why and how they differ : \u2705 CSAF (Common Security Advisory Framework) \ud83d\udccc Primary Use: Reporting vulnerabilities Designed for: Structured, machine-readable vulnerability advisories Standardized by: FIRST (Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams) Used by: Red Hat, Cisco, Siemens, SUSE, GitHub (via tools), and others Focus: CVEs, CVSS, remediation, affected products, exploitability \ud83d\udcc8 Adoption: Increasingly adopted in both open source and enterprise contexts Supported by tools for publishing , consuming , and aggregating advisories Tied closely to CVE ecosystem \ud83d\udd27 Example Use Cases: Vendor publishes a CVE advisory in CSAF format Security scanner ingests CSAF feed to update vulnerability database Third-party services map CSAF advisories to SBOMs \u2699\ufe0f OSCAL (Open Security Controls Assessment Language) \ud83d\udccc Primary Use: Compliance and assessment automation Designed for: Representing security controls, assessments, and FedRAMP-type packages Standardized by: NIST Used by: FedRAMP, cloud service providers, and assessment bodies Focus: Compliance documentation, control catalogs (like NIST 800-53), SSPs, POA\\&Ms \u274c Not Designed for: Reporting vulnerabilities CVE publication CVSS or remediation workflows \ud83e\udde9 Example Use Cases: A SaaS provider builds an OSCAL System Security Plan (SSP) to submit for FedRAMP authorization An auditor uses OSCAL to assess compliance against NIST controls \ud83e\udd47 Summary Table Feature CSAF OSCAL Purpose Vulnerability advisory Security control documentation Standard Owner FIRST NIST Focus CVEs, patches, remediation FedRAMP, NIST 800-53, POA\\&Ms Popularity for vuln reporting \u2705 High \u274c Very low Tooling & ecosystem support \u2705 Strong (vendors + tools) Moderate (mostly government-focused) Best used for Security advisories Compliance automation \u2705 Final Verdict: Use CSAF for vulnerability reporting \u2014 it\u2019s purpose-built, well-supported, and actively used in security ecosystems. OSCAL is not meant for this use case , though it\u2019s great in the compliance domain. Let me know if you want real CSAF examples or how to integrate CSAF feeds into your pipeline. Chat 4 Isn't OSCAL designed for reporting vulnerabilities via POAM? You're absolutely right to raise that\u2014 OSCAL can include vulnerabilities , but only indirectly , and it's important to clarify how that differs from something like CSAF. \u2705 Yes, OSCAL supports vulnerability reporting within POA\\&Ms OSCAL includes a POA\\&M (Plan of Action & Milestones) model, which can document: Identified system weaknesses or vulnerabilities Planned remediation actions Timelines and responsible parties Risk severity and mitigation status So vulnerabilities can be represented in OSCAL , but: \u26a0\ufe0f Key Differences from CSAF Aspect OSCAL POA\\&M CSAF Primary Purpose Compliance tracking (e.g., FedRAMP, NIST RMF) CVE-based security advisories Audience Auditors, compliance officers, GRC teams Security teams, vendors, scanners, developers Structure of Vulnerabilities Generic \"weaknesses\" or findings (not CVE-focused) Structured CVE data with exploitability, remediations Remediation Focus High-level (who/when/how fix planned) Detailed (patch, workaround, CVSS, affected products) Integration with scanners \u274c Not common \u2705 Supported in many tools and feeds Typical Use Case FedRAMP POA\\&M spreadsheet replacement Public vulnerability advisories, CVE dissemination \ud83e\udde0 Analogy: OSCAL POA\\&M : Think of this like a compliance backlog : \"Here's what\u2019s wrong, here's how we\u2019ll fix it.\" CSAF : Think of this like a vendor security bulletin : \"CVE-2024-1234 affects X. Patch Y fixes it. CVSS 9.8.\" \ud83d\udeab Why OSCAL Is Not Popular for General Vulnerability Reporting OSCAL isn't used outside of regulated compliance workflows like FedRAMP, where POA\\&Ms are a formal requirement. It lacks built-in constructs for: CVE ID resolution CVSS scoring Exploitability indicators Affected product enumeration (like CPE/PURL) \u2705 When to Use Each Use Case Best Format FedRAMP SSP/POA\\&M for a SaaS service OSCAL Internal vulnerability management in GRC tool OSCAL or CSV Publishing CVEs to customers/consumers CSAF Automating triage for container/image scans CycloneDX + VEX or CSAF \u2705 Conclusion: OSCAL does support vulnerability tracking through POA\\&Ms , but it is not designed or commonly used for vulnerability disclosure or reporting in security operations . For those tasks, CSAF is far more appropriate and widely used. Let me know if you'd like to see an example of a vulnerability tracked in OSCAL POA\\&M format vs CSAF!","title":"Vex Format"},{"location":"chats/chat_2025-06-03_vex-format-most-popular/#vex-format","text":"","title":"Vex Format"},{"location":"chats/chat_2025-06-03_vex-format-most-popular/#chat-1","text":"what is most popular for vulnerability reporting with remediation and false positive info? especially for container scans like MS Defender and AWS Inspector?

The method further includes, in response to determining that the match metric is below the match threshold value computed for each one of the plurality of teams, creating a new team, and associating one of the matching team or the new team with the meeting for prospective meeting attendees. Collaborative communications environment and automatic account creation thereof Link: US10805101B1 Abstract A method includes receiving a signal associated with an electronic meeting invitation for users to attend the electronic meeting. The users include members of an organization and at least one nonmember of the organization. Responsive to receiving the signal, an online collaborative team is automatically created within an online chat environment. The team members of the online collaborative team include the members and the at least one nonmember. In some embodiments, an online collaborative team account is automatically created for the at least one nonmember responsive to determining that the at least one nonmember has no online collaborative team account. Method and apparatus for cryptographic key storage wherein key servers are authenticated by possession and secure distribution of stored keys Link: US7711122B2 Abstract A key management system includes secured data stored on a first system secured by a control key stored securely on a key server. The secured data is secured against attacks such as unauthorized use, modification or access, where authorization to access the secured data is determined by knowledge of an access private key of an access key pair. When an authorized user is to access the secured data, the first system generates a request to the key server, signed with the access private key, wherein the request is for a decryption control key and the request includes a one-time public key of a key pair generated by the first system for the request. The first system can decrypt the decryption control key from the response, using a one-time private key. The first system can then decrypt the secured data with the decryption control key remaining secured in transport.","title":"Patents (3)"},{"location":"patents/#johns-patents","text":"","title":"John's Patents"},{"location":"patents/#methods-and-systems-for-associating-a-team-with-a-meeting","text":"Link: US20220207488A1","title":"Methods and systems for associating a team with a meeting"},{"location":"patents/#abstract","text":"A method for associating a team with a meeting for prospective meeting includes receiving a meeting invitation comprising first information, wherein the first information comprises data identifying the prospective meeting attendees, receiving second information for a plurality of teams, wherein the second information comprises data identifying members for each one of the plurality of teams, comparing the first information with the second information to determine a match metric for each one of the plurality of teams, and determining a matching team from the plurality of teams for which the match metric is above a match threshold value.

The culling process does not necessarily take into account the composition of the data set; and may, in fact, impede the expediency and cost-effectiveness of the eDiscovery process as ESI not initially identified may need to be collected later in the eDiscovery process. This exclusionary eDiscovery approach has been recommended by search and information retrieval technology providers in the past, in part, based on the state of technology available at the time; however, the technology now exists to perform an inclusive, content-based, investigative eDiscovery across a large document collection without the introduction of semiarbitrary exclusion factors. In this paper, we investigate whether limited document retrieval based on custodian email mailboxes results in lower recall and produces fewer responsive documents than a broader, inclusive search process that covers all potential custodians. In order to compare the two approaches, we designed an experiment with two independent teams conducting electronic discovery using the different approaches. We found that searching across the entire data set resulted in finding significantly more responsive documents and more initial custodians than implementing an approach that relies on custodian-based culling. Specifically, investigative eDiscovery found 516% more relevant documents and 1825% more initial custodians in our study. Based on these results, we believe organizations that employ an exclusionary, culling-based methodology may require subsequent collections, risk under production and sanctions during litigation, and will ultimately expend more resources in responding to eDiscovery production requests with a less comprehensive result.
