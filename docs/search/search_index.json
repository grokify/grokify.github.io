https://devportalawards.org/nominees/2020/ringcentral Overview https://devportalawards.org/ Why the DevPortal Awards? We wanted to create an opportunity to showcase innovative leaders and their developer portals in the API and interface space. The DevPortal Awards is an opportunity to celebrate the work that goes into developer portals that are not only targeted to developers but also aligned to business needs and operable by its maintainers. The DevPortal Awards seeks to recognize the best solutions available today and push the boundaries of what we believe to be the key components of a developer portal for tomorrow. Award Introduction of the portal RingCentral Developers portal combines powerful APIs with a focus on usability and community. Developers will find quick start guides that create apps for them in a matter of minutes, interactive documentation, tutorials, SDKs for 11 languages, and more combined with RingCentral's focus on supporting their community through live chat, forums, social media, and even with free 1-1 developer support. Once in the Developer Portal, developers will also find more details including usage and error analytics to help them monitor their app's health. Then there's RingCentral's Game Changer program that rewards developers with prizes like swag, conference passes, and even electronics like iPads and Macbook Pros just for helping others in the community! Why nominated Extremely user friendly documentation Language specific quick start guides \"one click\" button to create a quick start app. SDK support (11 languages) Innovative widgets including RingCentral Embeddable API analytics and user dashboards Game Changers program (learn about the RingCentral API and get rewarded) 2019 - API World - Best in Communications APIs https://medium.com/ringcentral-developers/ringcentral-wins-api-worlds-best-in-communication-apis-for-second-year-40a79169bd81 2018 - API World - Best in Communications APIs https://medium.com/ringcentral-developers/voted-best-in-communications-apis-for-2018-48d1f82edece 2018 - Nordic APIs - Best Public API https://nordicapis.com/best-public-api-of-2018/ ( pdf ) We had 10 nominees for the Best Public API of 2018 award, we received a ton of votes from the community, and now we\u2019re happy to announce that the winner of the Best Public API of 2018 competition is RingCentral! The RingCentral API enables multi-faceted business communication abilities, including voice, SMS, messaging, meetings, and fax. Their developer friendly program features extensive docs, sample apps, and a wide SDK library. Here are some motivations from the communities votes: All around fantastic engineering and ease of use Ability to implement SMS into my website in 20 minutes! It just works. 99.99 reliability It allows communications from within a bunch of apps that Small Businesses and Enterprises use on a regular basis (like Google apps, Microsoft cloud apps, SalesForce, etc.).

IC Agile CAPE Project LeSS SAFe International Scrum Institute AgilityHealth Overview When participating in an Agile development environment, it can be useful to have a certification, whether it is in Scrum, Kanban, DevOps or another approach. This article covers my experiences and observations with several certification organizations including Scrum Alliance, Scrum.org, and International Scrum Institute. Additionally, I have looked into some organizations such as Scrum, Inc., ICAgile, SAFe, and LeSS. Scrum Alliance The oldest and most popular Scrum certification organization is the Scrum Alliance. Scrum Alliance, Scrum.org and Scrum Institute are some of the most popular Scrum certification organizations. I started off with Scrum Alliance and Scrum.org as they are among the most popular organizations. I took a CSM and CSPO class after which I took the Scrum.org assessments for PSM I and PSM II. Eventually PSM II was renamed to PSM III so I was awarded that and PSM II, the new intermediate cert. Over time, I took some certs from Scrum Institute, starting off with OKRs and Design Thinking, but then signed up for a Masterclass Bundle which resulted in many more certifications at a very cost-effective price. Overall, I think it's worthwhile to get different perspectives on the process. Scrum Alliance Scrum Alliance was founded in 2002 by Mike Cohn, Esther Derby and Ken Schwaber. It is the largest Scrum organization and focuses on human interaction via classes and conferences. Classes and conferences are great ways to learn because you can share your experiences with others in the field. A consequence of the focus on classes and conferences are that it is a larger commitment, both from financial and time perspectives to participate in Scrum Alliance certification paths. Scrum.org Ken Schwaber left Scrum Alliance in 2009 and created Scrum.org with a slightly different mission, but to still train Scrum practioners. The assessments done by Scrum.org are generally considered more difficult to pass, do not require renewal, and have classes that are optional rather than mandatory. There are a number of common tracks such as Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Developer, as well as specialist certificates in Scrum with Kanban, Scrum with User Experience, Scaled Professional Scrum, and Evidence-Based Management. An additional benefit of Scrum.org participation, is that they support and online forum. The gold standard in Scrum Master certification is from Scrum.org. [...] The number of certified professional Scrum Masters at each of the three levels testifies to the certifications\u2019 progressive difficulty. In 2022, there are over 460,000 Scrum Masters certified at the PSM I level, but only 18,000 certified Professional Scrum Masters at the PSM II level, and just over 1,000 individuals certified at the elite PSM III. The PSM III certification is certainly one to pursue if you want to differentiate yourself from others. Darcy DeClute, Scrumtuous Inc. Scrum, Inc. IC Agile CAPE Project International Scrum Institute International Scrum Institute is known for the cost-effective certifications and training material they provide. They are a corporate member of Agile Alliance and have certified over 673,700 people as of November, 2023. Commonly called just \"Scrum Institute\" per their domain name scrum-institute.org , they are a popular choice due to low certification fees, high success rates, and non-expiry of certificates. Additionally, they have some atypical certifications including Design Thinking and Objectives & Key Results. Some program key highlights include: certifications do not expire PDF certificates and online badges one fee provides 10 chances to pass the exam if the example cannot be passed after 10 times, the fee isrefunded many certificates have a 98% - 99% pass rate Some example pass rates are below: Scrum Master Accredited Certification\u2122 Program - 98% examination success rate Scrum Product Owner Accredited Certification\u2122 - 98% examination success rate Scaled Scrum Expert Accredited Certification\u2122 - 98% examination success rate Agile Scrum Leadership (Executive) Accredited Certification\u2122 - 99% examination success rate Additionally, they provide cost-effective certificate bundles which provide many certificates for one price: Masterclass Bundle: 8 Certifications For Scrum, DevOps and Kanban Professional Leadership Masterclass Bundle: 8 Certifications For Scrum, DevOps and Kanban Leaders Summary I generally enjoy both formal and experiential forms of learning.","title":"Scrum Certification Paths"},{"location":"certificates/scrum_certification-paths/#scrum-certification-paths","text":"Scrum Alliance Scrum.org Scrum, Inc.

This article outlines the additional knowledge and insights gained during the renewal process and emphasizes the significance of staying up-to-date with Scrum certifications. Introduction Renewing my Scrum Alliance certifications for Certified ScrumMaster (CSM) and Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO) turned out to be a more rewarding experience than I had anticipated. In this article, I will share the valuable insights and learnings I acquired during the renewal process, emphasizing the importance of staying connected with Scrum Alliance and its resources. This is what my certificate looked like when I received it in 2012: And this is what it looked like in 2023 with the inactive notice. Of note, the design changed, but so much time had passed that an intermediate design had come and gone as well. The Decision After over a decade since initially obtaining my CSM and CSPO certifications, I decided it was time to renew them. Despite working in various agile organizations during the intervening years, I hadn't felt the need to update my certifications. However, circumstances changed when I found myself in an organization undergoing an agile transformation, prompting me to advance my agile journey with Scrum Alliance. My goal was to progress through the Advanced levels and beyond, which required me to update my certificates through education and a fee. Initially, I viewed this as a mere prerequisite for accessing the Advanced level programs. However, I soon realized that the journey itself held immense value, and I found great benefit in acquiring the required education, as detailed below. The Requirements Renewing my certifications initially seemed daunting due to the substantial amount of time that had passed and the requirement of 40 Scrum Education Units (SEUs) for both my CSM and CSPO certifications (20 each). However, it turned out that I only needed 30 SEUs in total, thanks to a 10 SEU discount for renewing both certifications simultaneously. To meet the SEU requirement, I explored various avenues, including: Reading articles. Watching videos. Attending conferences and meetups. Engaging in volunteer work. While volunteer Scrum work was the most SEU-rich option, it proved to be scarce and required some lead time. Similarly, attending conferences and meetups took time. Consequently, I began by watching videos and reading articles. Initially, I manually inputted these activities into the Scrum Alliance website, but later discovered the convenience of automatic SEU tracking. The Content Throughout the renewal process, I delved into numerous articles and watched several videos. These resources expanded my understanding and appreciation of Scrum and Agile methodologies. Some of the articles were so informative that I saved them for future reference. Here are a few noteworthy articles: Get in FRONT of the Daily Scrum by Bonsy Yelsangi 7 Traits of a Good Facilitator by Scrum Alliance The Differences Between Project Managers and Scrum Masters by Natalie Barnes The Anatomy of a User Story by Jim Schiel How to Stop Facilitating the World's Most Boring Meetings by Vibhu Srinivasan How Much Detail Should Be In My Product Roadmap? Sample Sprint Review Agenda & Tips from a Coach by Joel Bancroft-Connors How to Become a Catalyst Leader 3 Traits Great Agile Leaders Display (Plus 1 Factor That Doesn\u2019t Matter at All) Great Scrum Masters Demonstrate 5 Key Values Measuring Progress Toward Agility The Renewal The Scrum Alliance dashboard provided an informative progress meter, updated in near real-time after completing content on the website. Surprisingly, I made faster progress than expected, earning 0.25 SEU per article. By the time I completed my renewal, my dashboard indicated significant progress, and I successfully updated my certification, which was now active once more. This is what my dashboard looked liked part way through the process. By the time I renewed, my dashboard looked like the following: And I was able to update my cert, which showed it was active again. The Community Scrum Alliance's thriving community is one of its greatest strengths. From mandatory classes to conferences and various resources, Scrum Alliance fosters a sense of belonging and collaboration. I appreciated that my certificates included the names of Certified Scrum Trainers who had instructed me: Michael James for CSM and Chris Sims for CSPO. Moreover, the renewal process allowed me to become acquainted with more members of the Scrum Alliance community through the articles they authored, some of which I mentioned earlier. Witnessing the active participation of individuals in writing articles and engaging in Scrum Alliance programs was inspiring. Summary Scrum Alliance's emphasis on people, through its classes, conferences, content, and community, makes it a valuable organization. The certification renewal process, requiring Scrum Education Units (SEUs), not only enhances one's knowledge of content but also deepens their connection to the Scrum Alliance community. I eagerly look forward to continuing my learning journey with this organization and its dedicated members.","title":"The Value of Renewing Scrum Alliance Certifications (CSM and CSPO)"},{"location":"certificates/scrum_scrumalliance-renewal/#the-value-of-renewing-scrum-alliance-certifications-csm-and-cspo","text":"","title":"The Value of Renewing Scrum Alliance Certifications (CSM and CSPO)"},{"location":"certificates/scrum_scrumalliance-renewal/#tldr","text":"Renewing my Scrum Alliance Certified ScrumMaster (CSM) and Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO) certifications exceeded my expectations and provided valuable benefits.
